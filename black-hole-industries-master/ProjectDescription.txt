Alternate dispute resolution approach:  All people that have an idea 
and can’t come to an agreement put a finger on the screen of a phone
 for the game tap roulette which is basically eeny meeny mo.
 
 
	The goal of this social media platform is to enable student 
	developers and even experienced developers to connect with each 
	other in order to work on personal projects.  Having the ability 
	to easily find peers to work on projects is important part of 
	growing as a developer.  Users can make posts for others to find 
	and respond to in order to make groups with each other.  Once a group is formed 
	users in that group will create projects and collaborate on them.  Users will also 
	have the ability to view each other’s projects and profiles and leave comments on them.  
	Our platform will also have direct messaging for those working on projects together. 
	For those who don’t want to work on the projects or with a developer but are 
	interested in what they are doing can follow the developer/team so they can keep 
	tabs on their latest work.

	The typical user of this social media platform is intended to be students from 
	High School to college although experienced developers is not our intended audience 
	they are still welcome so students can see them as role models.  Students will use 
	this website to network with each other to form project groups and follow experienced
	developer’s profiles so they can learn directly from those in the field.
